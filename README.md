# mirrorControl

## The project
MirrorControl is an educational Arduino example based around building your own laser projector project. 
The project requires each student to build the device based on mirrors, stepper motors and a laser pointer and then use code to draw figures or play around.

## MirrorController library
MirrorController is a stepper motor controller class designed to control stepper motors that are combined with mirrors in order to make a simple 'laser show'. 
This class creates a sawtooth oscillation and allows you to control the speed, amplitude offset and phase of the oscillation. 
Each parameter can be controlled in real time (using external sensors) which allow for a smooth transition and creative movements.
